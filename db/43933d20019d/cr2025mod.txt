1 SEC. 1403. FINDINGS.

2

Congress makes the following findings: 3

(1) Semiconductors underpin the United States 4

and global economies, including manufacturing sec-5

tors. Semiconductors are also essential to the na-6

tional security of the United States.

7

(2) A shortage of semiconductors, brought 8

about by the COVID–19 pandemic and other com-9

plex factors impacting the overall supply chain, has 10

threatened the economic recovery of the United 11

States and industries that employ millions of United 12

States citizens.

13

(3) Addressing current challenges and building 14

resilience against future risks requires ensuring a se-15

cure and stable supply chain for semiconductors that 16

will support the economic and national security 17

needs of the United States and its allies.

18

(4) The supply chain for semiconductors is 19

complex and global. While the United States plays 20

a leading role in certain segments of the semicon-21

ductor industry, securing the supply chain requires 22

onshoring, reshoring, or diversifying vulnerable seg-23

ments, such as for—

24

(A) fabrication;

25

(B) advanced packaging; and

(6) The SelectUSA program of the Department 9
